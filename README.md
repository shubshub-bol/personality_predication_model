Personality Classification: Introverts vs Extroverts

This project explores the classification of personality types (Introverts and Extroverts) using machine learning models and behavioral features. The dataset includes social and lifestyle attributes such as time spent alone, stage fear, social event attendance, going outside, and social media activity.

📊 Results

Achieved high classification accuracy across multiple models.

Key influential features: Time spent alone, Friends circle size, Going outside.

Decision Tree and Ensemble models provided interpretable feature insights.

🚀 Storytelling Approach

The project not only evaluates models but also presents results as a story of introverts vs extroverts, showing how different behaviors shape personality classification.
